      "I had my first attempt in 2009 while I worked on securing a bachelor's degree in Sweden, that dream was shattered due to the non-availability of funds or sponsors fast forward to 2020, I came about Mr. Amusan's post on Linkedin I adopted those series and became an addicted follower, read all the post, emails, Youtube channel, all Japa series, I  actioned on the webinars put together by the Co-Founder. Then came 2021 now a reality, my entire family and myself are already in the UK, that happened in 12 years of dedicated effort towards achieving the relocation dreams. I can't wait to see this become the next slogan on CNN ''NetWebPay willbecome the Bank of the Future for Immigrants''.",

      'After the event of 20-10-20, I knew the country wasn’t for me anymore. Thankfully, the team at NetWebPay was a step ahead of me, I attended a 2 hour webinar organized by vesti on Saturday, 24th of October 2020 and it changed my orientation forever. When SA said He was ready to work with many who were ready to move within 12 months, I keyed into that and the the vesti team and I began working actively towards my relocation. Today, I am in the United States of America, and none of it would be possible without “Japa webinar 1.0” and the great work being done by the team at NetWebPay.',
